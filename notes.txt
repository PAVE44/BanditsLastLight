Captain, the situation is critical, we are losing every battle, the knox county is overrun by this things.

CONCCEPTS:

soldiers have their teams assigned
soldiers have their ids assigned
when guardposts are disignated each soldier has his own guardpost
if soldier dies, the ids are renumerated, guardposts are regenerated
this is important for circle formation where we want to keep even distribution for example
leaders are marked, only they affirm commands


AI TEAMS HAVE DIFF PROGS
RAVEN 1 FRONT
LEFT
RIGHT BEHIND

ON ME

TAKE POSITION >
    - CURSOR

lets the player place the cursor and that generates guardposts depending on a formation
the number of guardposts reflects the current team size
if the formation is circle then if the team is small they should be evenly distributed

FORMATION >
    - LINE
    - FILE
    - WEDGE
    - CIRCLE

changes the assigned formation

now if the guardpost is placed it removes all guardposts for that team and places new ones depending on a new formation structure

if no guardpost is set for the team it uses the formation to follow the player

WEAPONS
    - FREE
    - HOLD

changes the weapons bit (will need to modify bandits for this one)

EMBARK / DISEMBARK


STATUS

this invokes the teamlead to report the status of the squad
which is team size 
the amount of enemies (should say it's clear or we have multiple enemies) 
and ammunition status


RELIEVE
    - CONFIRM

changes the program to lonely squad
